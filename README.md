A reactive language!
This was more of a concept I made in early grade 11 of the language I am making now (might still be [here](https://desgroup.me) or [here](https://github.com/1whatleytay/page)).
There were lots of workarounds but it was a lot of fun to make.
I couldn't figure out how styling should work.
I wish I could give you an example of the language, but I don't rember exactly how the syntax went.
I really enjoyed making this.
